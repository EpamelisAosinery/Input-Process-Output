# Epamelis Aosinery

Welcome to the Epamelis Empire and here is a little bit about myself. When I was young, I was very interested in software engineering, but because of the situation back then; therefore I didn't have the opportunity to interact with it until many years later. My first programming language was Python. Python is easy to learn, understand the logic, and build a solid knowledge of coding. So here we are, I will show you what I have learned and hope it will help you too.

## *5 Fundamentals about Python*

1. IPO model: Input -> Process -> Output
2. Built-In and User-Defined Functions
3. Decision Statements
4. Looping (Repetition) Statements
5. Input Validation and Arrays (Lists)
